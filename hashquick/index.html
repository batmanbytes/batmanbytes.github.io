    <h1>Proof of Concept</h1>
    <h2>User steps</h2>
    <!-- Ordered list -->
<ol>
  <li>Main page displays some basic info, but does a very important process in the background: It crawls MRR to find cheap hashrate. More about this step will be described below this list. The reason this is important is because the user must be aware of the rates, before moving forward. For example, he may select 10 PH/s, for 24 hours. The backend should automatically search MRR for the best rate, given that data, and if this would cost e.g., 60 sat / TH / day, we can display him a multiple of that cost.</li>
  <li>User is asked to fill a simple form of how much hashrate he wants to rent, for how many hours, which cryptocurrency payment etc. His payment can be deducted by both his Altquick balance, or by completing an independent-to-altquick deposit.</li>
  <li>Before paying anything, the user is aware of the rental cost, but needs to configure his pool first. If he pays before he configures his pool, we risk refunding due to invalid pool.</li>
  <li>Once we have his (valid) pool, and have received his money, we move forward to the API communication process: (follows API terminology)
    <ul>
        <li>We use "PUT /rental" to create a new rental. As inputs, we use the rig ID of the best rig our search algorithm found from step 1, and the hours user requested as length etc.</li>
        <li>We use "GET /rental/[ID1];[ID2];.../graph" to show user a graph of his hashrate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Potential problems that might arise and that we have to resolve:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Our search algorithm finds a cheap rig, but that rig is offline / does not mine at the moment. What do we do? Do we temporarily blacklist it and search for another?</li>
    <li>After paying, the user receives sufficient hashrate, but somewhere in the middle, the rig's hashrate declines. What do we do? Do we refund him? Or do we try to find another rig?</li>
    <li>His pool might be valid, but BOOST miners might not connect for some reason. Probably "PUT /account/pool/test" takes this into account.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Crawling from MRR</h2>
<p>To find the cheapest rig from MRR, we need to take account the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Min hours of rental. If the rig's min hours is greater than the user's requested time, we ignore it.</li>
  <li>Same goes for maximum hours of rental. It can be improved in the future, though, because if a rig rents for 96 hours max, we can re-rent it once it finishes, and therefore achieve rental length greater than 96 hours. [LOW PRIORITY]</li>
  <li>The requested hashrate. If user wants 100 PH/s, we should accept his request only if every single criterion is met.<ul>
    <li>100 PH/s is available to rent, in sum, from both SHA256 and SHA256-BOOST. For example, if there are 50 rigs, each selling 2 PH/s, then this criterion is met. This particular criterion won't be easy to check, instantly, because searching MRR's rigs might take some time. This will probably be implemented using "GET /rig", which lists all rigs of a specified algo, identically to the algo's marketplace page. We can then sort them based on hashrate, in descending order (from most hashrate, to least).</li>
    <li>Every one of these rigs are online / offer hashrate at the moment.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Once all previous criteria are met, and the average price for each TH/day is, say, 80 sats, we can charge the arbitrage, and show that (e.g., 220 sats).</li>
</ul>

<p>That's the overall concept. The rest of the implementation will be hidden in the details. Theoretically, that's the structure of hashquick.</p>

<p>This is how it could look on a first glimpse. (Images generated using ChatGPT.)</p>
