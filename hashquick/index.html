    <h2>User steps</h2>
    <!-- Ordered list -->
<ol>
  <li>Main page displays some basic info, but does a very important process in the background: It crawls MRR to find cheap hashrate. More about this step will be described below this list. The reason this is important is because the user must be aware of the rates, before moving forward.</li>
  <li>User is asked to fill a simple form of how much hashrate he wants to rent, for how many hours, which cryptocurrency payment etc. His payment can be deducted by both his Altquick balance, or by completing an independent-to-altquick deposit.</li>
  <li>Before paying anything, the user is aware of the rental cost, but needs to configure his pool first. If he pays before he configures his pool, we risk refunding due to invalid pool.</li>
  <li>Once we have his (valid) pool, and have received his money, we move forward to the API communication system:
    <li>sds</li>
